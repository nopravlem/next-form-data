I created a form using NextJS and connected it to MongoDB.
I deployed using Vercel, so you can access the site [here](https://next-form-data-six.vercel.app/).

This is using NextJS's App Router,and everything is styled with Material UI

## Demo
1. Type in information, submit data, and you'll be redirected

2. It will be saved in MongoDB

## Run locally
If you'd like to run this program locally, clone this project and create a `.env.local` file and add in `MONGO_DB_URI` variable. This is an example of what it should look like: 
```bash
MONGO_DB_URI="mongodb+srv://pravtadikonda410:<my_secret_password>@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
```

You should use be able to get this by going into your MongoDB cluster. Click **Connect** > **Drivers**

To see your username & password, go to **Quickstart** on the sidebar, and autogenerate (and copy) your new password.

Then, run one of these commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
OR
```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
